GH-371 Test Objectives:

PCP:
    Send packet with invalid opcode, get error
    (Can't find gateway yet)
    Find public IP
    Create short-lived mapping to port we control, get success
    If that works, delete short-lived mapping before it expires, get success

PMP:
    Send packet with invalid opcode, get error
    (Can't find gateway yet)
    Find public IP
    Create short-lived mapping to port we control, get success
    If that works, delete short-lived mapping before it expires, get success

IGDP:
    (See if there's some way you can get an error from IGDP)
    Find gateway, compare with user-supplied router IP
    Find public IP
    Create short-lived mapping to port we control, get success
    If that works, delete short-lived mapping before it expires, get success
