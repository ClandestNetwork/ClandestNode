# PREAMBLE THE GREYPAPER

Readers may be thinking “Why is this document is called a ‘Greypaper’, and not a Whitepaper?

The team’s combined years of experience in business, technology, cryptocurrency and project management yielded an interesting idea - one of the MASQ team decided that there had to be an alternative to the mainstream idea of releasing a Whitepaper.

Whitepapers are exactly what they sound like – written in black and white and often outlining definitive goals and deadlines.

This Greypaper will be a living and evolving document that can be updated on a needs-basis with accurate information. All the while providing enough starting information for readers to appreciate the general vision and purpose of the project.

Through this, MASQ aspires to not only be transparent in their goals and intentions, but also to avoid hype, disappointment and misinformation.

# INTRODUCTION

MASQ is a community-driven project aimed at solving the problem of internet censorship by repressive regimes. The project team is addressing this by building a decentralized mesh network which happens to also be censorship resistant.

By doing so, it will allow content available on the World Wide Web to be accessible to anyone and everyone with an internet connection, all while allowing users to both share internet freedom and have an incentive to dedicate their excess bandwidth to the network.

Through a unique approach combining programming, blockchain application, network encryption, software design and self-healing autonomous network structures, MASQ intends to deliver an Open Source solution to a growing Real World set of issues.

MASQ’s vision is that its use can attract over 1 million users across millions of devices and create an ecosystem of applications that leverages the decentralized mesh network.

# SOLUTION – POWER OF THREE

The software solution is made up of three design components: 

 - Encrypted - Completed - Mention TLS or “like a VPN”

 - Untraceable - Completed - Data is sent through a multi-hop network route that changes too quickly to trace
<a id="clandestine"></a>
 - Clandestine – In progress as of Oct 2019 - Will hide not only the data, not only the route, but also the very fact that the user is using MASQ at all

# FOUNDING PRINCIPLES
 
## Decentralized Governance
The MASQ team intends to have a core group of individuals forming a committee. At an agreed point, the committee will dissolve, allowing the Open Source project to be fully decentralized.
There will be no CEO, and practical methods will be applied to ensure no one person controls the entire project.

## Community Spirit
The MASQ team have all been born of other projects and communities - they understand that without the true spirit of ‘By the Community, for the Community” the network and thus the project will cease to exist. From these humble roots, the team want to actively grow the Community and realize the full potential that the project can bring to the modern world of internet communication.

## Privacy
MASQ intends to keep user privacy as an utmost priority, as without true privacy of the network participants, the network cannot grow to its full potential across the world to restricted countries, where access to such a solution could come with severe penalty from Government and watchdog agencies.
Similarly, members of the core team will remain pseudo-anonymous until such time that the network will be completely immutable, and there is little to no external threat to them. Some core members are willing to be openly identified.

# KEY PROJECT GOALS CURRENTLY

### Clandestine Routing

### Docker-Style CLI Interface

### Neighborhood Modes

### Terminal Intelligence

### Auto Port-Forwarding

# NEXT STEPS

## MASQ Project GitHub is Open Source
The MASQ [GitHub] is an Open Source fork of Substratum (the code base was created and developed by Substratum LLC, a registered US company based in Tennessee) – under the GPLv3 license. All the forked source code used from the latest repo of Substratum will be cited as such and credit given properly.

Starting repositories include forks of:
* [SubNode]
* [SubTNT]
* [sub-contract]

## Tokenomics will be determined to faciliate use of MASQNode

**This is still being discussed at length in MASQ committee and will be announced when details are finalized**
